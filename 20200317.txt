### A 0:37 - 0:45

I am so pleased to be here today as the United States and Japan announce a new partnership to educate girls across the globe.

### B 0:46 - 1:14

Right now as you heard, sixty two hundered million girls worldwide are not in school.And when we talk about this issue,we often focus on the economic barriers girls face.School fees or uniforms or how they live miles away from the nearest school and have no safe transportation,or how the school in their community doesn't have bath rooms facilities for girls so they just can't attend.

### C 1:15 - 1:32

But we know that problem here isn't just about the infrastructure and resources. It's also about attitudes and beliefs. It's about whether fathers and mothers think their daughters are as worthy of an endcation as their sons.

### D 1:32 - 1:59

It's about whether communties value girls simply for their bodies for their household,labor, their productive capacities or whether they value girls minds as well.

It's about whether the societies cling to laws and traditions that oppress women,or whether they view women as full citizens and entitled to the same rights and freedoms as men.
