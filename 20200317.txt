### A 0:37 - 0:45

I am so pleased to be here today as the United States and Japan announce a new partnership to educate girls across the globe.

### B 0:46 - 1:14

Right now as you heard, sixty two hundered million girls worldwide are not in school.And when we talk about this issue,we often focus on the economic barriers girls face.School fees or uniforms or how they live miles away from the nearest school and have no safe transportation,or how the school in their community doesn't have bath rooms facilities for girls so they just can't attend.

### C 1:15 - 1:32

But we know that problem here isn't just about the infrastructure and resources. It's also about attitudes and beliefs. It's about whether fathers and mothers think their daughters are as worthy of an endcation as their sons.

### D 1:32 - 1:59

It's about whether communties value girls simply for their bodies for their household,labor, their productive capacities or whether they value girls minds as well.

It's about whether the societies cling to laws and traditions that oppress women,or whether they view women as full citizens and entitled to the same rights and freedoms as men.

### E 2:00 - 2:08

And if we're honest with ourselves, we have to admit that these kinds of challenges aren't just limited to the developing world.

### F 2:09 - 2:23

For example while we have made the tremendous in girl's education in the United States and Japan, women in both our countries still struggle to balance the needs of their families with demand's of their careers.

### F 2:24 - 2:51

We still struggle with the outdated beleif that a women can not be both accomplised  professional and a devoted mother, that she has to choose between the two.

But the reality is that when we put limits like this on women's lives.We stifle their potential.And more importantly we miss out on so much of what they have to offer our societies.

### G 2:52 - 3:08

And for me that's where this issue gets personal. See, I grew up in a working class neighborhood, a place where hardly anyone went to university.Many people worked long hours and low salaries to struggle to pay their bills.

### H 3:09 - 3:26

As a youg girl, I was bright, outgoing with plenty of thoughts and opinions of my own.But like a lot of young women, I was often primarily defined by my relationship to men in my life.

### I 3:27 - 3:39

I was the father's daughter.Or even though I was just as small as my brother,I could hit a ball, just as far,I could run just fast, I was always just his little sister.

### J 3:40 - 3:48

When I got to school,I sometimes encountered the teachers who assumed that a girl from a humble background like mine wouldn't be a successful student. 

### K 3:49 - 4:16

I was even though told that I would never get accepted to the prestigiuos school like Princeton of University so I shouldn't apply.

Like so many girls accross the globe, I got the message that someone like me wasn't supposed to have the big dreams, that I should keep my head down,my voice quiet,and I should make myself just a little of smaller to fit others, people's modest expectations.

### L 4:17 - 4:35

But I was lucky.I have the parents who beleived me.〇〇 are 〇〇 〇〇 speak up to make myself 〇〇 〇〇 〇〇. So I had held first my dreams. I worked hard in school.And I wanna head to apply for Princeton and I got it accepted.

### M 4:36 - 4:54

And I wanna become a lwayer, a city goverment employee, a hospital exectuive and a director of the organization to train youg people to serve the communities.And most of all, I became a mother.Which is the 〇〇 far in the most important job I’ve been ever for my life.

### N 4:55 - 5:02

Now continuing in my career and raising my daughters wasn’t easy. But for me This was the right decision.
